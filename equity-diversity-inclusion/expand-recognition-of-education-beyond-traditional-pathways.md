# Expand Recognition of Education Beyond Traditional Pathways
Inaccessibility has led to adaptation in the learning market where individuals can gain the skills they need in a way they see fit. In order to help meet the demand for digital talent, alternative forms of education can and should be recognized and accepted in the labour force.

The traditional view of digital learning is seen as an individual attending a post-secondary institution and receiving a formal degree. Although beneficial, this type of formal education can be inaccessible to many individuals given the time and cost implications. This inaccessibility has led to adaptation in the learning market, **giving rise to a new brand of schooling (e.g. MOOC’s & Bootcamps) where individuals can gain the skills, they need in a way they see fit.** In order to help meet the demand for digital talent, these alternative forms of education can and should be recognized and accepted in the labour force.

**83%** of Alberta employers felt a college diploma and university degree were the minimum job requirements for digital roles in the province                      – A Digital Future for Alberta, ICTC

The current Alberta ecosystem places a large emphasis on post-secondary education. The Information and Technology Council of Canada (ICTC) surveyed employers on their preferences of academic education. The results found that **44% of employers require a university degree in a STEM field for employment4.** 

The emphasis of post-secondary education places more importance on the choices an individual made early on in their academic career rather than their current ability to learn and be productive in the economy. **The technology ecosystem should instead be centered around developing a culture of life-long learning.** Alternative education pathways can provide a steppingstone in this direction. This is because any individual, regardless of their current academic pedigree, can continue to learn.

As it stands, industry demands are driving the skills required in the workplace. These demands are changing more frequently due to the changing landscape of digital. Employers will need a system in which they can up-skill employers in a short amount of time as they will not be able to subsidize extended absences for workers to attend post-secondary education. An alternative learning method will be required to provide workers with the opportunity to develop new skills while still being able to contribute to the workplace.

Lastly, for an organization to succeed in the digital economy, its employees will need to possess a diverse range of skills outside of traditional STEM curriculums. A study conducted by the World Economic Forum has shown that skills like critical thinking, problem-solving, and active learning will drastically increase in importance by 20252. **Employers will need to expand beyond the STEM post-secondary education requirements and look for individuals who are more well rounded in the arts and humanities to ensure the workforce is ready to tackle digital.** 

# Objectives
The overall objective of expanding education is to broaden the ecosystem’s perspective around what it means to be educated. This will ultimately provide any individual who is willing to put forth the effort to learn with the opportunity to take advantage of the digital growth in coming years. This objective also relates to the emphasis that digital technologies place on technical skills. For an employee to be productive in the workplace, they will also need to possess a more holistic skill-set that includes human skills such as critical thinking and collaboration. 

* **Inclusive Recruiting Environment** Develop a more inclusive recruiting environment by creating acceptance of individuals who have taken alternative learning pathways to obtain skills.
* **Meet Digital Talent Needs** Leverage alternative education pathways to help employers meet open job demands. Shift candidate assessment from pedigree to competencies. 
* **Foster Culture of Life-Long Learning** Inspire individuals to continue learning long after their education is complete. This includes both technical and human skills. 

# Activities
* **Highlight Credibility** One of the factors inhibiting the acceptance of alternative education is the lack of credibility. Groups looking to provide these opportunities need to demonstrate examples of similar projects being successful in the past. They can also engage notable talent to help deliver course material.
* **Socialize Benefits** Learning providers will need to focus on socializing the benefits of their programs. Employers are looking for ways to recruit digital talent and provide training to their current workforce. Alternative education pathways have an advantage in that they are a more accessible means of dynamic training.
* **Encourage Student Action** An individual looking to become a part of the digital economy will need to become comfortable learning quickly. Students should begin accessing these new alternative education pathways to help fuel their growth. 
* **Maintenance of Curriculum** For alternative education pathways to become successful, it is important that they remain up to date with industry demands. They will need to partner with employers and the government to ensure that their curriculum is up to date for the benefits of the students.

* Researchers
* Industry Governing Associations

# Considerations
* **Inclusive Access to Alternative Education Pathways** Some alternative education pathways such as boot camps and certificates can still be expensive. This financial barrier can deter people from attending. To ensure inclusive opportunities, a focus should be placed on maintaining a cost structure that is fair for both education providers and learners. 
* **Quality Assurance of Curriculum** There is no regulatory body that oversees the curriculum taught in alternative education systems. This causes a wide variety in the quality of graduates from each institution. Alternative education providers will need to collaborate with industry partners as well as government to ensure their graduates are developing the correct skills. 
* **No Employment Guarantee for Graduates** Graduates of these programs or individuals who are self-taught may have an up-hill battle when competing for jobs with applicants possessing traditional degrees or diplomas. Students must view these alternative education pathways as a supplement to their current skill set, not a direct ticket into a job.
