# Engage and Support Equity-Seeking Groups
Internal diversity has benefits to both employers and equity-seeking groups. Organizations that rank highly in ethnic and gender diversity are more likely to achieve higher financial returns than less diverse organizations in their same industry5. The problem with a lack of diversity workforce is apparent within Alberta. The province has amongst the lowest employment rate of equity-seeking groups6. 

**The unique perspective every individual brings can help fuel innovation and spur growth. Diversity is a strength.** Engaging with and providing opportunities for individuals from equity-seeking groups - women, LGBTQ individuals, newcomers, BIPOC, and others - can strengthen the transition to a digital economy. 
This play looks to highlight the benefits that diversity brings and provides actionable steps to develop a more diverse talent ecosystem.
