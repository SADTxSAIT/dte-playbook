# Engage and Support Equity-Seeking Groups
Internal diversity has benefits to both employers and equity-seeking groups. Organizations that rank highly in ethnic and gender diversity are more likely to achieve higher financial returns than less diverse organizations in their same industry5. The problem with a lack of diversity workforce is apparent within Alberta. The province has amongst the lowest employment rate of equity-seeking groups6. 

**The unique perspective every individual brings can help fuel innovation and spur growth. Diversity is a strength.** Engaging with and providing opportunities for individuals from equity-seeking groups - women, LGBTQ individuals, newcomers, BIPOC, and others - can strengthen the transition to a digital economy. 
This play looks to highlight the benefits that diversity brings and provides actionable steps to develop a more diverse talent ecosystem.

# Objectives
**Equity, Diversity and Inclusion is a mindset, not a specific program.** It is the responsibility of the entire ecosystem to ensure that everyone has proper access to opportunities to succeed in both their education and career. Everyone brings a unique perspective and set of experiences that they can offer to the ecosystem to help push innovation forward. Furthermore, the benefits to creating a more equitable and inclusive environment are wide-spread. They help not only the equity-seeking groups, but talent-seeking organizations, community organizations and learning institutions as well. 

* **Increase Organizational Diversity** Strengthen organizational diversity by increasing the support, confidence, resiliency and motivation of these groups. Enrich organizational culture by inter-weaving the culture from different groups into one.
* **Fuel Innovation** Improve innovation across the ecosystem by bringing more individuals to the table. This broader range of thought can help improve the skill set of every individual while simultaneously increasing the speed at which the community innovates.
* **Decrease Unemployment Rates** Decrease the unemployment rates of equity-seeking groups that exist within Alberta by incorporating entire ecosystem. This requires governments be involved from a legislation standpoint as well as community organizations and learning institutions.

# Activities
* **Re-Design Recruitment** Develop recruitment initiatives that are tailored to equity-seeking groups. EDI is not achieved in isolation. All partners in our ecosystem will need be engaged. Solutions will need to be co-created to ensure benefit to everyone.
* **Increase Representation** Learning institutions and talent-seeking organizations will need to prioritize diversity across leadership positions. Equity-seeking students and employees will have a higher chance of success within their organizations if they can see themselves reflected at all levels of the hierarchy. 
* **Develop Networks of Connection** Provide an opportunity for equity-seeking groups to connect with each other through the development of employee resource groups. This allows individuals to develop a network of support or mentorship to tap into throughout their career.
* **Expand Education Recognition** Education requirements have become too narrow. Employers only hire from certain schools and majors. Canadian newcomers who are educated and highly-skilled are being neglected due to this.  The ecosystem needs to develop new initiatives to assess this group.

# Stakeholders
* **Community Organizations** Community organizations support equity-seeking groups by providing a network of support and mentorship
* **Government Institutions** Government organizations play a role in allocating funding for EDI initiatives as well as enacting immigration laws. 
* **Equity-Seeking Groups** Equity-Seeking Groups can play a major part in helping to drive innovation by drawing from their unique experiences. 
* **Talent-Seeking Organizations** Talent seekers can help equity-seeking groups by creating and implementing unique diversity programs for each equity-seeking group.
* **Learning Institutions** Learning institutions can help equity-seeking groups by providing scholarships, support groups and additional resources to help individuals with their journey to digital. 

# Considerations
* **No Blanket Solution for Diversity Programs** Developing a single diversity program that is targeted towards all equity-seeking groups is an insufficient approach. Ecosystem partners (Talent Seekers, Talent Developers, Government, Community Organizations) will need to co-create tailored and targeted EDI programs. This will likely increase demand on the human resource department and financial cost for talent-seeking organizations.
* **Lack of Equity-Seeking Groups in Current Talent Pool** Talent seekers may face difficulty sourcing candidates as traditional recruitment channels (e.g. external organizations or learning institutions) lack diversity. Organizations will need to bring more equity-seeking individuals into the ecosystem through sponsorship and development programs.
* **Potential Collaboration of EDA Programs Across Organizations** Talent developers and seekers tend to develop and implement their equity, diversity and inclusion initiatives in isolation. This can lead to several similar programs across organizations. Organizations should consider collaborating to build joint EDI programs enhancing the overall program quality by pooling resources and funding.
