# Overview of the topic


# Play Introduction
Provocations, interviews, discussions and experience have led us to include two plays in this MVP. They are valuable both for their content and as concrete examples of plays. We invite you to review, test, discuss and share your insights into how to continue to improve (or retire!) these plays. We also hope that these concrete examples help spark ideas and provide guidance as you create new plays.

## Adopt a Digital Intelligence Framework
For the first play, Adopt a Digital Intelligence Framework, we focus on getting to an aligned view on what it means to be digital. How can we possibly succeed as an ecosystem if we have a fuzzy view on areas, maturities, readiness, literacy, skills, knowledge, attitudes and values? These are core foundational elements for our ecosystem!

You may have already bumped into us at a community event, a meeting or at meetup talking about digital intelligence. In each case, we’re sharing, but also testing ideas in support of this play. We invite you to explore the play, the recommended digital intelligence framework and the implications it has for you, your organization and the overall digital talent ecosystem.

## Create Skill Maps
Aligning on a digital intelligence framework is a great start. But there are additional, adjacent and overlapping areas, maturities, literacies, skills, knowledge, attitudes and values that are realized in a multitude of roles, career paths and learning experiences. We need to find ways to help everyone navigate these options and find the best path forward. This is especially challenging as we don’t have the time to investigate all paths, nor do we have the funding to launch expeditions. Our second play, Create Skill Maps, focuses on helping us navigate this challenging environment. Through these efforts we’ll establish foundations that help us find the data, demand, connections, learning options, credentials and experiences we need to thrive.
