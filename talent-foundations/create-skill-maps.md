# Create Skill Maps

# Overview
Digital innovations are radically impacting careers, learning paths, innovation and recruiting. We face a challenge of both new skills, changing skills and a half-life of skills that is shrinking. Our response to these challenges must itself, embrace being digital. Such efforts will leverage data from the ecosystem to reduce friction, provide clarity and help all members of the ecosystem optimize the talent development journey. New mindsets, approaches and technologies enable us to gather, consider, and assess skills both at scale and on a personal, individual level. These efforts support both jobs of the future and existing jobs that are transforming. 

**Map new, existing, or modified skills to job roles.**

Skill mapping defines the specific skills and capabilities required for emerging digital jobs and identifies which skills workers already possess. Digital skills mapped include both technical and human skills, addressing the need for individuals to work alongside technology in the new digital age. Skill mapping emphasizes the need to assess skills on the individual level as a starting point for further development. Used as an assessment, skill mapping can identify skill gaps across the individual, organizational and ecosystem level. 


# Objective
**At its core, skill mapping provides the foundation and framework for stakeholders to define and assess skills and competencies and address any gaps accordingly.** This type of skill recognition and identification enables a more fluid and seamless talent marketplace. Individuals can identify any necessary skills they are lacking and create an efficient learning plan. After mapping the skills of their current workforces, organizations can identify skill gaps and develop tactics to begin addressing them. This type of targeted assessment and skill acquisition can deliver faster and more effective reskilling and upskilling processes.

**Key objectives to skill mapping are identifying which skills are needed, as well as enabling skill matching at the individual level.** Through skill matching, individuals can assess which skills they have acquired and developed over time and through the transparency of skill mapping for other roles, they see which digital roles they may be suited for. For example, a chemical engineer may have the statistics knowledge required to become a data analytics professional in an emerging industry with minimal training. Skill matching highlights these types of opportunities across a talent pool and provides the transparency for increased talent mobility both within organizations and externally. 

**These skill mapping capabilities are critically important in fields and industries where digital disruption is too often overlooked.** Digital is (going to be) everywhere! We need insights not only into emerging “jobs of the future”, but also how future skills are changing existing jobs. For instance, skill mapping can assist us in keeping skilled trades such as construction, manufacturing and cooking up to date, safe, innovative and productive.   

**Skill mapping is not meant to be a one-time exercise.** This process is meant to enable organizations to stay up to date with emerging digital skills to consistently address skill gaps. The insights from a skill-based mindset can lay the foundation for an organization’s talent strategies, providing a language to discuss roles and skill development practices.

# Activities
## Inputs
**Start by agreeing on key definitions and initial frameworks.** Skill mapping should be rooted in a shared framework for assessing digital skills, knowledge, qualities and overall competencies – all of which must be observable. Avoid trying to ”boil the ocean” – there are many careers, skills and paths. Focus on the areas that are most important to you and your stakeholders.

**Build on these initial efforts by finding existing datasets, tools, and services.** Learning and (re)learning will be ongoing. Reuse existing offerings to drive experiments, gauge impact and adapt. Learning can be further accelerated by sharing, operating openly and engaging with the digital talent ecosystem. 

**Seek opportunities to be digital.** A key step in implementing skill mapping across an organization is the planning around scaling the approach. Through the introduction of intelligent technologies such as AI, organizations can even begin to automate the skill mapping process to provide greater efficiency in talent decisions.

## Outputs
**Update Professional Development Approaches.** A skill map details connected, adjacent and related skills resulting in rich insights on a range of career opportunities. Professional development approaches should be updated to account for more paths and options. There will be more routes to success, more opportunities to transition, greater recognition of existing skills, and fewer barriers when trying to plan and advance our careers.

**Adjust talent strategies.** Streamlined skill gap identification will also deliver a shorter feedback loop for talent professionals. A shorter feedback loop offers new opportunities for interventions and adjustments. Interventions could include coaching, mentoring, targeted training, secondments, apprenticeships, XR experiences, and others that we have yet to imagine!


# Stakeholders
Our Digital Talent Ecosystem is comprised of many participants and interactions with immense complexity as we consider the many permutations of careers, people, technologies and skills. Navigating the ecosystem in a way that leads to successful outcomes is a challenge! Let’s look at the positive impact of creating skill maps through the lens of some of the stakeholders: 
* **Talent-Seeking Organizations:** Implementing a skill-based mindset and beginning to skill map can lead to success through transparent communication with all involved stakeholders. 
* **Government (Gov):** By assessing and reporting digital talent gaps in a skill-based manner, governments can enable individuals and organizations to proactively equip themselves based off the reported demand. 
* **Technology partners:** Skill mapping companies have developed solutions to support and scale skill mapping within talent-seeking organizations. These partners are integral to the implementation of skill-mapping in today’s digital environment.   
We also need to be especially mindful of prospective and current workforce participants:
* **Prospective workforce participants** can leverage the skill mapping to target their skill development for desired roles. For those in-between roles, skill matching can help take inventory of the skills they currently have and highlight a more direct path to a digital role with similar foundational skills. 
* **Current workforce participants** can utilize the work done by their employers to identify skills they may want to develop. They can use skill mapping efforts to gauge internal mobility to other roles with similar skills. 

# Considerations
## Talent Inertia and Mindset
For skill mapping to work for an organization, there must be a certain level of buy-in from leadership, talent professionals and employees. The mindset of “well this is the way we have always hired” is a direct barrier to unlocking the transparency and mobility that skill mapping can provide.  
## Complexity of Defining Skills
Certain skills (e.g., collaboration) can be difficult to define and measure. Although traditional certifications and credentials provide a foundation for measurement, skill mapping must include experience, knowledge, attitudes and values as well. A strong framework for assessing and identifying skills is core to skill mapping and must be aligned on at an early stage across the entire organization and potentially the whole ecosystem.   
## Fear of Exposing Skill Gaps
Skill mapping highlights the strengths of an organization and its people, but it also identifies weaknesses in the form of skill gaps. This poses a risk as individuals within an organization may be hesitant to point out their own skill gaps. Developing and communicating an understanding in the value of identifying skill gaps is a potential mitigation tactic. This fear emphasizes the need for psychological safety and the reduction of friction in the learning ecosystem for effective skills mapping to occur.
