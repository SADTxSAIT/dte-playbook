Digital innovations are radically impacting careers, learning paths, innovation and recruiting. We face a challenge of both new skills, changing skills and a half-life of skills that is shrinking. Our response to these challenges must itself, embrace being digital. Such efforts will leverage data from the ecosystem to reduce friction, provide clarity and help all members of the ecosystem optimize the talent development journey. New mindsets, approaches and technologies enable us to gather, consider, and assess skills both at scale and on a personal, individual level. These efforts support both jobs of the future and existing jobs that are transforming.
