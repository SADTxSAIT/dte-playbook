# ADOPT A FRAMEWORK FOR DIGITAL LITERACY, SKILLS, AND READINESS

# Overview
Our society faces an important question. **What does it mean to be digital?** A requirement for a thriving Digital Talent Ecosystem is a common language. In this case, we’re focused on getting alignment via frameworks that help all of us align on what one needs to be digital. **This foundation for understanding digital highlights intersections between digital, technology and key themes like ethics, literacy, privacy, well-being and identity. Understanding our digital maturity, gaps and opportunities for growth is crucial for supporting our digital ambitions.**

**The increasing importance and penetration of intelligent technologies, new business models, and adaptive ways of working are pressuring organizations to define what it means to be digital.** A critically important step in answering this question is to find our way to a common framework that supports all individuals, organizations and communities in our digital talent ecosystem. A framework for digital literacy, skills, and readiness provides a foundation
that enables all of us to DEFINE, MEASURE and NURTURE digital maturity. 

# Objective
Adopting a framework for digital literacy, skills, and readiness can deliver many benefits but at its core it will provide a unified foundational language to discuss maturities, literacies, certifications, and digital ambitions both internally and across an entire ecosystem. This type of alignment can foster collaboration and innovation between key ecosystem stakeholders such as talent-seeking organizations, government institutions, learning institutions and workforce participants.

The phrase “... a rising tide lifts all boats” is especially relevant in this discussion. While creating a framework is important and valuable, the true impact comes as the framework is adopted and is commonly used across the ecosystem. This framework should also support breaking down silos. Fewer silos and barriers will deliver more alignment, greater collaboration, more innovation and a stronger ecosystem. This foundation amplifies the contributions and efforts of the ecosystem!

Leveraging a framework for digital literacy, skills, and readiness can support development of ecosystem-wide recognition of skills, knowledge, attitudes, values, certifications, and accomplishments to close skills gaps and support greater workforce mobility.15

Ideally, such a framework also recognizes that we are currently defining our digital society. Seeing our moment in time, we can shape and define the characteristics of that society. Recognizing and supporting ethics, well-being, sustainability, agency and responsibility will enable our ecosystem to design and execute on a meaningful future that every stakeholder can understand, appreciate, and thrive in!

**36%** Of Calgary employers state that the largest factor inhibiting digital growth is a lack of talent.16

**2x** the increased amount of time an employee stays at a company with strong internal mobility. This delivers decreased hiring, retraining and lost productivity costs.17

**$11.5T** Potential lost GDP growth over the next 10 years across G20 countries if innovation continues to outpace digital skill development.18

## Which Framework? And why pick one?
There are multiple frameworks for digital literacy, skills and readiness available. History has shown us that the quickest and most effective path forward is by aligning on core standards and then learning, innovating and competing at higher levels. We’ve seen this with railway gauge, internet protocols, shipping containers and across industries. Standards reduce friction, ease communication, simplify the problem space, let us focus on the bigger picture, and advance more quickly.

In the case of a framework for digital literacy, skills and readiness – select a standard that moves us forward in both being digital and moving at the speed of digital. [The DQ Digital Intelligence Framework from IEEE is recommended for use in our Digital Talent Ecosystem.](https://www.sait.ca/about-sait/who-we-are/sait-schools/school-for-advanced-digital-technology/articles-and-publications/building-calgarys-digital-intelligence)


* **Recommended** The DQ Digital Intelligence framework is an international standard published by [IEEE](https://standards.ieee.org/standard/3527_1-2020.html). There are options for customization and a path to influence future versions of the standard. DQ has input from the WEF, OECD and the UN Sustainable Development Goals.
* **Use as a Reference** DigComp is a framework created, supported and used by the European Union. Documentation for the framework is freely available. Case studies and tooling are available as further reference.
* **Avoid** Creating your own digital intelligence framework can be a tempting option. This is a long and expensive journey, especially if a goal is to get adoption outside of your organization. This is an especially poor place to start.

# Activities
## Inputs
**The first step in adopting a framework for digital literacy, skills, and readiness to evaluate which framework best fits with your goals and circumstances.** 

As the foundation for digital planning and conversations, the framework should embody your ambitions, priorities and values. Engage colleagues in these early effortsto support broad adoption later. These efforts may lead to a need to revisit your strategy and goals.

Building on this first step, quickly follow up by examining what other ecosystem members are using as well as similar players in different geographies or industries. Engaging with the ecosystem, collaborating with others, and joining discussions transparently is critically important. Operating in isolation, opaquely, and with only an inward focus will limit progress, impact, and innovation.

## Outputs
**After selecting a framework, focus transitions to adoption planning.** 

Initial adoption can include piloting the new framework across the organization, testing and measuring its effectiveness. Since organizations are at different levels of digital and business maturity, it is important to adjust adoption strategies accordingly. A company that from its beginning has been running in agile might feel comfortable testing and iterating on their framework, whereas a more traditional organization could require further planning for a thoughtful adoption.

A standard framework provides the opportunity for ecosystem partners to share lessons learned. At a minimum, organizations should communicate with their ecosystem to evolve together and share learnings. Ideally, the framework is supported by a standards body that supports input, updates regularly and promotes the framework. Co-creating localized customizations to the framework is an option, but deviation from standards reduces the value of the standard. Try to minimize customizations and instead seek ways to influence and shape the standard.

Also, recognize that there are other types of frameworks that may complement and further advance your needs. Look to combine frameworks within your organizational environment to gain further clarity on how digital connects with all aspects of your efforts, investments and innovations.

# Stakeholders and the accelerating power of shared frameworks
Our Digital Talent Ecosystem is comprised of many participants and interactions. The friction from describing digital competencies differently impacts every one of us. The friction leads to waste, duplication of efforts and an inability to communicate and collaborate. If we can get the entire digital talent ecosystem to share a common view on digital competencies, we can address these issues. 

Let’s look at the positive impact of an adopting a framework for digital literacy, skills, and readiness in our ecosystem through the lens of some of the stakeholders: 
* **Talent-Seeking Organizations:** Adopting a framework provides a unified language for discussing digital talent. This can be used to make decisions internally for all matters regarding talent acquisition, talent development, and enable greater understanding across the ecosystem.
* **Government (Gov):** An aligned and shared view reduces duplicate efforts, simplifies coordination and makes it easier for investments and legislation. In short, it makes it easier for government to take a role in helping people thrive in our digital society. 
* **Economic Development (Dev):** A framework that is widely adopted can bring increased innovation, talent development and economic strength to the economy.
* **Technology partners:** Tools, services, support and innovation arise as the ecosystem is digitally aligned.   
* **Learning Institutions:** Understanding what the ecosystem requires and educating students accordingly can better position students to succeed in the workforce.
* **Local and Globacl:** We also need to make special mention of **Digital Standards Institutions**, such as IEEE. These institutions stand alongside our digital talent ecosystem (and those found around the world). We engage, support and leverage the standards body to benefit our local ecosystem and feed into the larger global ecosystem.

# Considerations
## Pre-Conceived Notions
Pre-conceived and disparate notions of digital literacy, skills, and readiness can introduce friction when looking to scale or accelerate digital growth. In the past, talking points around digital workforce trends have centered heavily around technology, automation and loss of jobs. However, being digital should take a much broader and more holistic view. Further, being digital starts with people. Technology amplifies our talent and investments.

## Network Effect
The more organizations that use the same framework, the more value it provides. Therefore, organizations want to adopt a framework that is likely to be chosen by other ecosystem members. A fragmented ecosystem limits the impact of the ecosystem and digital intelligence frameworks. However, don’t get stuck in “analysis paralysis;” any strides towards beginning to define digital are more valuable than sitting still.

## Customization vs. Standardization
There is a balance to strike between customization and uniformity of the framework. As a framework for digital literacy, skills, and readiness is the foundation for an organization’s digital strategy, it is important to balance added layers of relevancy to the organization with remaining universally understood and connected. This risk can be mitigated through consistent ecosystem engagement and collaboration.


# Example: London Digital Skills Strategy
Setting out with the vision that “people and businesses, across the City, London and beyond, are equipped to take full advantage of digital technologies and innovations to help themselves and their economies thrive”, the Mayor of London wanted to double down on the city’s digital skills strategy19. Research and feedback from government, educational, and industry organizations highlighted that even with increased focused on digital skills, too few individuals were equipped to succeed in the digital economy. 

In order to address this challenge and achieve the vision for London’s citizens, the updated digital skills strategy emphasized three key pillars: digital competitiveness, digital creativity and digital citizenship. To help define these three key pillars and provide a grounding for the updated strategy as a whole, the Mayor and his team started with the DQ Digital Intelligence Framework.10

Harnessing the DQ framework and the new outlook on developing digital ready citizens, the city of London committed to consistently and openly collaborating with ecosystem partners such as educational institutions and local corporations to continue to shape the strategy and address immediate digital skills gaps together. Another key aspect of the strategy included the commitment of sharing the city’s learnings throughout the process with the greater digital community and yearly auditing of the strategy to address shortcomings and iterate for the future. The strategy is now on its fourth audit and continues to play a role in London’s digital talent development. This focus on collaboration, digital intelligence and scaling impact carries on today with the work of [FutureDotNow](https://futuredotnow.uk/).
