To advance efforts across a large group with many stakeholders we need a foundation of shared concepts. In the case of a playbook, it is critically important that we collectively agree on the definition and anatomy of a play – along with the lifecycle of a play. Key constructs that are defined differently across the ecosystem offer little value and become a source of friction. 
A play is: “…is a tactical initiative or set of activities that we can implement to work towards overcoming our digital talent challenges.” So, a “play” is a fancy name for a tactic or set of activities. And a playbook is a collection of plays, grouped together within a topic. Through the playbook and its collection of plays, we build a digital talent ecosystem specific vocabulary. In terms of anatomy, each play is comprised as follows:
* Name
* Overview
* Objective
* Activities
* Stakeholders
* Considerations
* Example

In terms of a **lifecycle**, we can imagine each play as its own “product”, seeking to be validated as solving a real problem and adding value to our digital talent ecosystem. That initial idea may arise from a provocation, first-hand experience, or through brain-storming and co-creation. The lean product lifecycle supports us in our efforts to make sure that the plays we create are valuable and continue to add value. And when they don’t, we retire the play.
The plays in this document have been developed by leveraging a combination of industry research, real-world use cases, and co-creation with folks just like you from the Digital Talent Ecosystem. Ideas emerge and need to be explored and validated. Ideally, they then grow in impact. But our work isn’t done. We need to sustain and support the play – keeping it up to date and enhancing as needed for it to stay relevant. When a play is no longer valuable and relevant, we retire the play. We are always focused on continuous improvement and adding value, focused on our “customers”. Who would you consider as a “customer” for a play? How would they perceive value?
