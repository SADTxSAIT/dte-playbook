# Learning Co-Development
The broader ecosystem will can redefine skill development by introducing a co-creation and co-delivery approach to education. This includes creating partnerships between digital organizations and academic institutions to help produce workers who are equipped to deliver on the job requirements of the future.

The rapid pace of innovation is making it difficult for both employers and academic institutions to produce enough highly-skilled digital talent. The broader ecosystem will need to redefine skill development by **introducing a co-creation and co-delivery approach to education.** This includes creating partnerships between technology organizations and academic institutions to help produce workers who are equipped to deliver on the job requirements of the future.

The speed of innovation is creating exponential change in modern ways of working and in the skills needed to succeed. As organizations attempt to keep pace with the dynamic environment, redefining how our talent ecosystems view learning has never been more important. The automation of jobs will result in employment issues for the current workforce, as many longstanding human tasks will be offloaded to machines. To mitigate these effects, our education system needs to evolve to enable efficient career transitions for affected workers. Accomplishing this will require participation from across the ecosystem; how can stakeholders best collaborate to support learning?

A gap exists between what employers require for modern jobs and what is taught in the classroom. From the perspective of someone looking to develop digital skills, the path forward can be ill-defined and unclear. There is a wide variety of information regarding the different tools and technologies that exist in the industry today, making it difficult to identify what is most relevant to their journey. Furthermore, the requirements for different employers are continuously evolving. This constant change can become difficult for academic institutions to incorporate into the education they provide, ultimately producing students who are not readily equipped for today’s workforce.

From an employer's perspective, one of the core issues that inhibits digital growth is the lack of highly skilled talent. A study conducted with Alberta employers has shown that the largest barrier to digital economic growth was the lack of available talent4. For organizations to realize the economic benefits that will come from this technological shift, they will need to play an active role in shaping the learning of students. Employers have a unique perspective on the skills required to succeed as they are on the front lines of innovation. These insights can allow academic institutions to become more relevant in their teachings, which will bridge the gap between education and industry. This will also give employers more exposure to students, which in turn will allow them to better understand future hires.

In summary, a systems approach to learning will need to be developed and implemented to ensure the talent pipeline remains steady, improving the entire technology ecosystem.

# Objectives
The overall objective of learning co-development and co-delivery is to create a healthy learning ecosystem. The ecosystem is comprised of three different groups. The opportunity seekers (Learners), opportunity providers (employers), and the educators (academic institutions). Each group has clearly defined objectives that the other groups will have a direct role in supporting. This means that for each individual group to fully prosper, the entire ecosystem must be successful - a symbiotic relationship. 
* **Learners** Provide students the opportunity to engage in relevant industry education, enabling them to acquire relevant digital skills and bridge the gap between theory and practice.
* **Employers** Enable organizations to have a direct influence in student learning to improve the quality of digital talent being produced, ultimately leading to more talent in the ecosystem.
* **Academic Institutions** Facilitate student-student and student-employer relationship building. Maintain and scale relevancy of student learning experiences to meet current and anticipated economic demand.

# Activities
**To create a culture of co-learning and co-development, a framework must be created to manage the involvement and expectations of each party.** Given the large number of active players in the technology ecosystem, this systems-focused framework needs to set guidelines around how multiple organizations can participate while providing an impact that supports learners, employers, and academic institutions. The health of one impacts the health of all; effective co-creation can help to push the entire ecosystem forward.
* **Learners** Seek out additional pathways of gaining experience. A few of examples of this include attending meet-ups, volunteering or building portfolio projects. Learners can also actively reach out to different employers to learn more about each company, resulting in a tighter ecosystem.
* **Employers** Partner with forward thinking academic institutions that are looking to provide a new learning path that meets industry demand. Share internal talent openly with education partners to create a richer learning experience for students.
* **Academic Institutions** Assess the current landscape of learning paths to identify organizations that are looking to innovate and have demonstrated experience in digital. Launch pilot programs with these organizations. Continue to monitor and iterate on programs to meet student needs.

# Stakeholders
The digital economy has drastically changed the way individuals will work in the future. This change requires a learning system that follows suit and provides students with opportunities to learn new skills and adapt the best way they see fit. Learning can no longer be a one-size fits all approach or confined to a single point in one’s career. A broad system of interconnected elements will need to co-create and co-deliver a new brand of learning that will help the entire ecosystem move forward.
* Technology Companies
* Accelerators & Incubators
* Academic Institutions
* Learners
* Vendors
* Community Support Organizations

# Considerations
* **Balancing Input from Multiple Organizations** Academic Institutions will need to co-create and co-deliver with multiple organizations to create a more relevant learning experience for students. It will be important to be mindful of over-indexing on a few employers or partners.
* **Quality Assurance of Student Learning** The content taught to students will continuously change as digital innovation increases. Learning experiences will increase in value, while content itself will become less valuable. Academic institutions will need to stay on top of learning paths to ensure that their credibility as well as that of their partners remains at a high level.
* **Shared Benefits Across Entire Ecosystem** Learning journeys will be tied to multiple academic institutions and organizations through this process. Trust will need to be built between each party to ensure that the benefits for the broader ecosystem are not sacrificed for the interests of a single partner.

# Example SADT PM x VR
The School for Advanced Digital Technology (SADT) is a hub for technology learning. SADT is part of the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology located in Calgary. The institution runs boot camps to help students develop technology-related skills. 

Starting in May 2021, SADT will offer 12-week product management and virtual reality boot camps. Students will spend the first six weeks in their respective streams. Product Managers will learn about agile, scrum, and managing product development. The Virtual Reality Bootcamp focuses on building a tangible product, emphasizing skills such as managing client specs, storyboarding, and design. The last six weeks will see the two streams come together to apply their learnings to a real business problem. SADT has partnered with the SAIT School of Construction to co-create and co-deliver two projects for the students to work on. Similar to the working world, students will be divided into product teams consisting of VR developers and product managers to tackle one of the problems.

SADT facilitates the content based on what industry demands require. They have conversations with experts in the ecosystem to discover what needs to be taught to prepare students for the future. SADT has also joined forces with industry leaders in VR and PM to bring students a one-of-a-kind learning experience. For the VR boot camp, this includes Red Iron Labs, Inception U and Exergy Solutions. SADT worked with both groups to iterate on the curriculum, hardware and software that students will be engaging with. On the product management side, Product Calgary will be involved in student learning and even help fund some of the student tuition. Course content will also be delivered by Red Iron Labs. These partnerships are a representation of academic institutions breaking the barrier between education and employment.
