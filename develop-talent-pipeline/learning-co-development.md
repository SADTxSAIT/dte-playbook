# Learning Co-Development
The broader ecosystem will can redefine skill development by introducing a co-creation and co-delivery approach to education. This includes creating partnerships between digital organizations and academic institutions to help produce workers who are equipped to deliver on the job requirements of the future.

The rapid pace of innovation is making it difficult for both employers and academic institutions to produce enough highly-skilled digital talent. The broader ecosystem will need to redefine skill development by **introducing a co-creation and co-delivery approach to education.** This includes creating partnerships between technology organizations and academic institutions to help produce workers who are equipped to deliver on the job requirements of the future.

The speed of innovation is creating exponential change in modern ways of working and in the skills needed to succeed. As organizations attempt to keep pace with the dynamic environment, redefining how our talent ecosystems view learning has never been more important. The automation of jobs will result in employment issues for the current workforce, as many longstanding human tasks will be offloaded to machines. To mitigate these effects, our education system needs to evolve to enable efficient career transitions for affected workers. Accomplishing this will require participation from across the ecosystem; how can stakeholders best collaborate to support learning?

A gap exists between what employers require for modern jobs and what is taught in the classroom. From the perspective of someone looking to develop digital skills, the path forward can be ill-defined and unclear. There is a wide variety of information regarding the different tools and technologies that exist in the industry today, making it difficult to identify what is most relevant to their journey. Furthermore, the requirements for different employers are continuously evolving. This constant change can become difficult for academic institutions to incorporate into the education they provide, ultimately producing students who are not readily equipped for today’s workforce.

From an employer's perspective, one of the core issues that inhibits digital growth is the lack of highly skilled talent. A study conducted with Alberta employers has shown that the largest barrier to digital economic growth was the lack of available talent4. For organizations to realize the economic benefits that will come from this technological shift, they will need to play an active role in shaping the learning of students. Employers have a unique perspective on the skills required to succeed as they are on the front lines of innovation. These insights can allow academic institutions to become more relevant in their teachings, which will bridge the gap between education and industry. This will also give employers more exposure to students, which in turn will allow them to better understand future hires.

In summary, a systems approach to learning will need to be developed and implemented to ensure the talent pipeline remains steady, improving the entire technology ecosystem.

# Objectives
The overall objective of learning co-development and co-delivery is to create a healthy learning ecosystem. The ecosystem is comprised of three different groups. The opportunity seekers (Learners), opportunity providers (employers), and the educators (academic institutions). Each group has clearly defined objectives that the other groups will have a direct role in supporting. This means that for each individual group to fully prosper, the entire ecosystem must be successful - a symbiotic relationship. 
* **Learners** Provide students the opportunity to engage in relevant industry education, enabling them to acquire relevant digital skills and bridge the gap between theory and practice.
* **Employers** Enable organizations to have a direct influence in student learning to improve the quality of digital talent being produced, ultimately leading to more talent in the ecosystem.
* **Academic Institutions** Facilitate student-student and student-employer relationship building. Maintain and scale relevancy of student learning experiences to meet current and anticipated economic demand.
