# Digital Talent Ecosystem - Playbook
The Digital Talent Ecosystem playbook offers topics, plays, examples, provocations and ideas to support YYC in how we share, collaborate and grow digital talent together.

The playbook is an invitation and a foundation for accelerating the impact of our Digital Talent Ecosystem. As an invitation, the Digital Talent Ecosystem Playbook is a call to collaboration and co-creation. The playbook is built to drive discussion, innovation, experimentation and rapid learning as Calgary and Southern Alberta seek to address the digital talent challenge. And as a foundation, the playbook provides guidance toward a share vocabulary that covers digital competencies, digital talent ecosystems, playbooks, and plays. 

We believe that the path to addressing complex and wicked problems is through collaboration and co-creation. As part of the digital talent ecosystem, we will share, experiment, learn and improve with you, our ecosystem partners. The playbook should be read, discussed, and continuously updated with plays that are valuable to Calgary and Southern Alberta. The playbook should support storytelling in the ecosystem, it should lead to experiments, it should lead to learning across the ecosystem. The playbook should be used to spark participation and engagement – directly in the playbook, via GitHub, working sessions, or in community events. The playbook should help break down silos within organizations and across the ecosystem.   

The Digital Talent Ecosystem Playbook is a living document. The plays themselves will be hosted in this open repository provide everyone with the opportunity to access, edit or copy into entirely new efforts. We’ll also continue to convene, connect, and learn – leading to new versions of the playbook. The content and timing of new versions will depend on all of us, our sharing, contributions and collaboration.
