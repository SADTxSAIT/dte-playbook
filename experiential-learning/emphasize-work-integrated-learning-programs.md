# Emphasize Work-Integrated Learning Programs
Industry partners should increase collaboration with educational and government institutions to develop and fund work-integrated learning programs (e.g. internships). These programs ensure upcoming talent is equipped with the skills needed in the industry today and ease the transition of new employees into companies.

Industry partners should increase collaboration with educational and government institutions to **develop and fund work-integrated learning programs** (e.g. internships). These programs ensure upcoming talent is equipped with the skills needed in the industry today, and ease the transition of new employees into companies. Through first-hand experiences, talent can assess the skills needed to succeed on the job while still in a position to easily overcome the skill gaps they identify, all without losing out on productive working time. Organizations can begin developing meaningful relationships with junior or transitioning talent while participants ground their formal skills education in real-life applications.

The global demand for digital skills has left talent pools relatively shallow14. Organizations that once might have relied on simply hiring more talent to meet demand are now forced to plan far ahead into the future. This presents a greater challenge for organizations; how can they proactively develop a talent strategy for digital skills that might not even exist yet? With the pace of digital innovation only increasing, this is a reality that must be considered. A potential answer to this question can be found in developing and planning around a strong talent pipeline. By creating lasting relationships with future candidates and the educational institutions they affiliate with, companies can stay aligned with the skills of the future and begin to bring in more of it to their organizations to address any skill gaps.

From the individual’s perspective, with the growth of micro-credentials and alternative means of developing digital skills outside of traditional educational programs, it is crucial to understand what skills employers demand in the real day-to-day of desired roles. While organizations begin to mature digitally there still may be a disconnect between the skills they believe they need from a high-level and the skills really needed to succeed in the role. This is made clear by 85% of workers thinking they need to develop new digital skills to remain relevant at work8. To truly understand what skills these are, individuals can benefit from completing the work first-hand. Additionally, these opportunities allow for the pipeline itself to gain ecosystem strength. Individuals can begin to build their professional networks while organizations build relationships with and assess the future workforce. These types of mutually beneficial programs can greatly fortify local talent ecosystems.

A final driver of why work-integrated learning programs are important is the need for organizations to be proactive in their acquisition and development of digital skills. As mentioned above, organizations can no longer take a passive approach to their digital talent strategy. Programs connecting organizations to talent assist them in developing their pipeline, not just to bring in more employees but to bring in employees with the right skills needed for the future.

# Objectives
The development of work-integrated learning programs has the potential to yield various benefits and returns to the organization itself, individuals (interns) and the entire ecosystem. The straightforward impact of a fresh set of hands within a company cannot be overlooked. Interns can provide work output beyond what a company may achieve with their existing workforce. Additionally, from a longer-term focus, **internship programs enable a deeper relationship between organizations and prospective talent.** These early relationships allow organizations to assess talent for digital competencies. If skill gaps are identified, interns are still in a learning environment and can develop these in-demand skills more easily than if they were already in the workforce, when they would need to dedicate siloed time for upskilling and training. This early assessment and “pulse check” of the talent pipeline highlights how work-integrated learning programs not only create a process for hiring new talent but can potentially smooth the transition of new hires into the workforce and efficiently meet skill demands.

A unique objective to work-integrated learning programs is the ability for an organization’s employees to learn from up-and-coming talent. This is referred to as “reverse mentorship” where it is not only interns learning from the experience of employees but employees also learning from the next wave of digital talent.

**Work-integrated learning programs pose an opportunity for individuals to explore emerging areas of interest.** The more diverse talent that finds an interest in digital skills and the motivation to develop digital competencies, the stronger the ecosystem will be. There are many benefits stemming from the efficacy of learning while working and these programs provide students with the opportunity to ground their formal education in real-world applications.

*"We believe that apprenticeship programs, particularly at the local level, are critical to igniting a spark of interest in the technology field and ultimately building a pipeline to help address the skills gap...” – Pallavi Verma, Accenture Senior Managing Director 15*

# Activities
## Inputs
In order to begin developing successful work-integrated learning programs, organizations must tackle a few crucial steps. At the core of a strong program is a collaborative relationship between organizations and educational institutions, which work as talent sources as well. In order to develop the skills needed through educational pathways as well as identify strong talent, organizations need to work closely with these stakeholders and ensure there is transparency in each party’s objectives. Proactively seeking out top talent from an early phase is a core foundation and can only truly be done with strong partners. 

It is also important to define processes which will be used to identify digital skill gaps and communicate potential gaps with all stakeholders. Continuously measuring the success and iterating to improve these programs will enable stronger outcomes and can differentiate organizations when it comes to digital talent. Merging these programs with short- and long-term talent strategies can align the proper investment and organizational focus into these programs.  

## Outputs
A larger and more capable talent pipeline is a key potential output of work-integrated learning programs. With a stronger pipeline comes increased options for organization to choose from, shifting decision making in the talent process back into the hands of employers. On an individual basis, prior program experience can deliver a more prepared new joiner, requiring less upfront training when starting work full-time. In order to continue with the strong cycle of a work-integrated learning program, measuring digital skill gaps throughout can test if program investments are addressing the organizational talent demands or if modifications need to be made. Overall, these programs will prepare individuals for the workforce and allow for organizations to seamlessly bring in emerging talent. 

# Stakeholders
Work-integrated learning programs involves various stakeholders, all with different objectives. Therefore, mapping these stakeholders out and understanding their goals is essential in developing an effective program. Organizations will have the opportunity to partner with educational institutions. These institutions can provide a connection to talent as well as an understanding of what digital skills are currently being taught. Professional organizations can serve as further verification of digital skills as well. 

**Arguably the most important stakeholders are the actual individuals or candidates that are taking part in these programs.** No matter the institution they came from, increased focus must be placed on nurturing these relationships as they form the basis of the digital talent pipeline. 

Government bodies play a role in supporting funding and general ecosystem guidance when it comes to work-integrated learning programs. Funding can enable organizations that may not be able to financially support these programs with the ability to receive the same resulting benefits as a larger organization. This can play a key role helping organizations secure digital talent and spreading this talent evenly across the ecosystem. 

Overall, transparency and communication across all of these different stakeholder relationships can help organizations reap the benefits of work-integrated learning programs.

# Considerations
* **Aligned Objectives** The objectives and value propositions of all stakeholders involved is a core experience driver. A poor internship experience can have negative long-term implications for both an individual and an organization’s reputation. In order to avoid this, all stakeholders should clearly communicate their goals, needs, and expectations. Balanced value propositions will assure that all stakeholders benefit from the experience.
* **Investment Required** There is a significant investment required to stand-up or enhance a work-integrated learning program. Along with potential government funding, organizations must prepare and plan for the potential investment requirements of bringing on digital talent in these capacities. In addition to the financial investment, the opportunity cost of employee time spent training, mentoring, and guiding participants must be factored into assessing this opportunity. Without the proper resource commitment, the value proposition of an organization becomes weaker and limits the upside of participating in this type of program. 
* **Talent Supply and Demand** There is a natural fluctuation of supply and demand for skills. Although the demand for digital talent currently outstrips supply, there is a possibility that this might shift in the future. Preparing for both situations will allow for organizations to flexibly navigate their programs and develop their talent pipeline based on their specific needs. 

# Example: Swiss Vet Program
Switzerland’s Vocational Education & Training System (VET) is considered the global gold standard for work-integrated learning programs16. It is a mainstream upper secondary program serving close to 70% of Swiss individuals -, most commonly students16. The program facilitates an apprenticeship, catering to both white-collar and blue-collar career aspirations. Most recently, through the global demand for high-tech industry skills, the VET program has played key a role in shaping Switzerland’s digital economy.

The program aligns all major stakeholders within the economy, bringing government, educational, and industry partners along with many others to the table to discuss the emerging workforce and how as an ecosystem they can improve it. Key to the environment-wide adoption is the focused participation of Swiss companies. Approximately 30% of all Swiss companies take part in the apprenticeship program16. This type of participation has proven the program’s value to talent and allowed them to commit to it throughout their educational journey. Along with the working aspect, the VET program facilitates seamless transitions from schooling or skill development into the workforce, or into higher education where the Swiss population can further develop young talent and address targeted points of the digital skill gap.

The VET program has entrenched a skill development culture amongst both public and private organizations as well as the general population. On the Global Talent Competitiveness Index, Switzerland ranks at the top among all factors in talent pipeline development16. When asked about their high ranking, Swiss CEOs attributed this achievement largely to the VET program and its ability to prepare the future workforce of Switzerland for the new digital economy16.   

# Example: Chicago Apprenticeship Network
In 2017, Aon and Accenture co-founded the Chicago Apprenticeship Network – partnering with local employers like McDonald’s, Zurich Insurance, and Walgreens to jumpstart their professional apprenticeship programs. Today, the network has 50+ member organizations and has achieved its initial goal to create 1,000+ apprenticeships17. This program was developed to highlight the importance of professional apprenticeships and the role they can play in closing the skills gap.

Work-integrated learning initiatives like the Chicago Apprenticeship Network allow for individuals in between jobs or interested in transitioning careers to sample what it is really like to work in different types of roles. These experiences not only support true skill development through real-life application but can serve to spark the interest of participants in digital technologies. 

This program strives to bring individuals with diverse backgrounds into emerging technology spaces, an opportunity they may not have had without this type of intervention. Not only do the participating companies benefits from these apprentices but the individuals can gain valuable skills and potential employment, benefiting the greater ecosystem and economy.
